This is in the works, and in the future there will be rewrites to decrease detection

**DO NOT USE THIS UNLESS YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT ACCOUNT DELETION**

This (currently) uses easily detectable methods like using uncompressed json instead of zlib'd etf like the normal apps do

This project is currently on a sort of hiatus as I focus on school, and is currently in the processing stage IE managing / handling the data.

**Development Plan**
[X] Program a websocket handler
[…] Manage the data and make objects to handle it easier
[ ] Make a simple quick and dirty dev oriented TUI
[ ] Switch over from json to zlib to better impersonate a normal client
**First public release** 
[ ] Add support for images and emojis using either catimg or unicode
[ ] Try to pretty up the UI
[ ] Easy alt account support with configurable privacy options
[ ] Add the configurator that lets you pretty much edit anything you want about the client
**Program is no longer indev**

after finishing the initial development stage, ill be focusing on making it easier to use, making the UI prettier, and porting features from the normal client
I'll also be adding optional ports of popular client mods that i like or am suggested, all configurable in the configurator
(ill also be noting which ones can risk detection and bans)



Posssible additions:
  translation support(?)
  add support for modding(?)
